- Hi, I’m Suresh Gopi
- I’m from Ohio,Kerala 
- I’m currently learning in Kala-kadayadi mone University, Ohio, Kerala 
- I’m looking to collaborate with Prithviraj(the last  Puthiya Mugham) and A10.
-  How to reach me? Just think of me
- Pronouns: Sulphuric Acid/Niggesh
-  Fun fact: 
If I, Suresh Gopi, fight Prithviraj (the Duplicate Indian Kalvarda Mone), who has regained all his powers and started his Domain Expansion 'Ryuki Tenkai: Puthiya Mughooow,' then he might cause me a little trouble. Do you think I will lose?
Nah, I'd win because I have the world's strongest Domain Expansion: 'Ryuki Tenkai: Polayadi Mone!!!'
